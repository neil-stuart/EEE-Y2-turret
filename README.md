# Second Year Robotics Project: Dart-Shooting Robot

## Project Overview
In the spring of 2023, as part of our second-year robotics course at the University of Galway, we embarked on an ambitious project in collaboration with Xperi Galway. Our goal was to design and build a remote-controlled dart-shooting robot for an internal class competition. This project not only aimed to put our theoretical knowledge into practice but also to foster teamwork and innovation within a real-world engineering environment.

## Features
- **Remote Control**: Utilized Zigbee for wireless communication, allowing for precise and responsive control over the robot.
- **Dart Shooting Mechanism**: Engineered to shoot darts with accuracy and speed, optimized for competitive scenarios.
- **Custom Power Delivery System**: Designed a robust power delivery circuit capable of driving DC motors and servos efficiently.
- **Schematic and PCB Design**: Developed detailed schematics and PCB layouts to ensure reliability and functionality.

## Technology Stack
- **Arduino**: Served as the heart of the robot, managing control logic and device operations.
- **Zigbee**: Enabled wireless communication between the robot and the remote control.
- **KiCAD**: Used for PCB design, facilitating the creation of custom circuit boards.
- **Fusion360**: Aided in designing parts and components for 3D printing, contributing to the robot's structure and mechanics.

## Challenges Faced
- **Power Efficiency**: Designing a power delivery system that balanced efficiency with the high power demands of motors and servos.
- **Wireless Communication**: Ensuring reliable and responsive control over wireless channels in a competitive environment.
- **Mechanical Design**: Integrating the mechanical and electronic components in a compact and functional design.

## Solutions and Learning Outcomes
- **Innovative Circuit Design**: Through extensive research and testing, we developed a power system that exceeded our requirements for efficiency and reliability.
- **Effective Team Collaboration**: Working closely with team members and leveraging each other's strengths led to a successful project outcome.
- **Practical Engineering Skills**: Gained hands-on experience in digital circuit design, PCB layout, and the integration of software and hardware.

## Future Directions
- **Autonomy**: Implementing AI for autonomous navigation and target acquisition.
- **Enhanced Control**: Exploring advanced control systems for improved precision and maneuverability.

## Conclusion
This project was a pivotal moment in our academic and professional development, providing us with invaluable experience in robotics, teamwork, and problem-solving. We are grateful for the opportunity to work with Xperi Galway and look forward to applying these learnings to future endeavors.
