# Dart-Shooting Robot Project

## Overview
This project was a key component of our second-year microprocessor systems engineering module, undertaken during the spring of 2023. The aim was to construct a remote-controlled dart-shooting robot for a class competition, blending aspects of mechanical design, electronics, and control systems.

## Features ðŸš€
- Remote control via Zigbee for wireless operation.
- Competitive dart shooting mechanism.
- Custom power delivery system for efficient motor and servo use.
- Designed electronic schematics and PCB for the robot's circuitry.

## Technologies Used ðŸ’»
- **Arduino**: Core control logic.
- **Zigbee**: Remote communication.
- **KiCAD**: PCB design.
- **Fusion360**: Mechanical design and 3D printing.

## Project Challenges 
- Maintaining reliable wireless control.
- Effective integration of electronic and mechanical parts.

## Outcomes 
- Efficient and reliable power delivery system.
- Experience in collaborative project development.
- Improved skills in circuit and mechanical design integration.

## Future Improvements ðŸŒŸ
